    <h1>ENGLISH LANGUAGE</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        English is a West Germanic <a href="ab">language</a> in the Indo-European language family, with its earliest forms spoken by the
        inhabitants of early medieval England.[3][4][5] It is named after the Angles, one of the ancient Germanic
        peoples that migrated to the island of Great Britain. Existing on a dialect continuum with Scots and then most
        closely related to the Low Saxon and Frisian languages, Modern English is genealogically Germanic. Although its
        grammar and core vocabulary are mostly West Germanic, it has borrowed many words from French (about 28% of
        English words) and Latin (also about 28%),[6] as well as some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse (a
        North Germanic language).[7][8][9] Speakers of English are called Anglophones.

    <p>
        The earliest forms of English, collectively known as Old English or "Anglo-Saxon", evolved from a group of North
        Sea Germanic dialects brought to Great Britain by Anglo-Saxon settlers in the 5th century; these dialects
        generally resisted influence from the then-local Common Brittonic and British Latin languages. However Old
        English dialects were later influenced by Old Norse-speaking Viking settlers and invaders starting in the 8th
        and 9th centuries. At the time, Old Norse even retained considerable mutual intelligibility with certain
        dialects of Old English (especially more northern dialects). Middle English began in the late 11th century after
        the Norman Conquest of England, when considerable Old French (especially Old Norman French) and Latin-derived
        vocabulary was incorporated into English over some three hundred years.[10][11] Early Modern English began in
        the late 15th century with the start of the Great Vowel Shift and the Renaissance trend of borrowing further
        Latin and Greek words and roots into English, concurrent with the introduction of the printing press to London.
        This era notably culminated in the King James Bible and the works of William Shakespeare.[12][13] The printing
        press greatly standardised English spelling,[citation needed] which has remained largely unchanged since then,
        despite a wide variety of later sound shifts in different English dialects.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <hr>
    </p>
    <p>
        Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent-marking pattern
        with a rich inflectional morphology and relatively free word order to a mostly analytic pattern with little
        inflection and a fairly fixed subject–verb–object word order.[14] Modern English relies more on auxiliary verbs
        and word order for the expression of complex tenses, aspects and moods, as well as passive constructions,
        interrogatives, and some negation.

    <h2>Early Modern English</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Modern English has spread around the world since the 17th century as a consequence of the worldwide influence of
        the British Empire and the United States of America. Through all types of printed and electronic media in these
        countries, English has become the leading language of international discourse and the lingua franca in many
        regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation, and law.[3] English is the most spoken language
        in the world[15] and the third most spoken native language in the world, after Standard Chinese and Spanish.[16]
        It is the most widely learned second language and is either the official language or one of the official
        languages in 59 sovereign states. There are more people who have learned English as a second language than there
        are native speakers. As of 2005, it was estimated that there were over two billion speakers of English.[17]
        English is the majority native language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, New
        Zealand, and the Republic of Ireland (see Anglosphere) and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean,
        Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.[18] It is a co-official language of the United Nations, the
        European Union, and many other international and regional organisations. English accounts for at least 70% of
        speakers of the Germanic language branch of the Indo-European family.
